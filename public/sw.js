// There is no server-rendered dynamic data anywhere in this app (no
// backend, no API routes) — every route is static and the Stockfish engine
// files are static assets — so caching is enough to make the whole app
// (including a game against the computer) work offline after the first
// successful visit to a given page/asset. Two different strategies are used
// depending on what's being requested:
//
// 1. Next.js App Router's client-side navigation issues its own internal
//    "flight" data fetches (marked with an `RSC: 1` request header) to move
//    between pages without a full reload. These must go NETWORK-FIRST: if
//    we served a cached copy while the network was actually available, an
//    older payload can be served with no way for Next's router to detect
//    it, silently breaking in-app navigation (this was reproduced: serving
//    a stale flight response instead of an available network response made
//    "Começar" stop navigating to /jogar, even online). Network-first
//    avoids that: online, we always defer to the real request, matching
//    Next's own behavior exactly; offline, we fall back to whatever was
//    last cached for that route.
// 2. Everything else — static assets (`/_next/static/...`, the vendored
//    Stockfish engine, icons, manifest) and real full-page HTML navigations
//    (hard loads/reloads, e.g. opening the installed app from the home
//    screen) — is CACHE-FIRST. These URLs are either content-hashed or
//    genuinely static, so a cached copy is always safe to serve
//    immediately, and we refresh the cache in the background for next time.
//
// We deliberately do NOT try to precache the hashed Next.js build chunks by
// URL: their filenames change every deploy, so a hardcoded list would go
// stale immediately. Runtime caching sidesteps that entirely — whatever the
// browser actually requests gets cached, whatever the current build's real
// filenames are.
